## Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

> [!Note]
> [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) I have created this REST API to be used in an example for JavaScript, allowing access to currency exchange functionality, can be accessed on [https://neotecs.netlify.app/api/currency](https://neotecs.netlify.app/api/currency). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/currency.js`. If you are intrested how i use this REST API, i leave the example in this link:<br>


[![Currency Exchange](https://img.shields.io/badge/Currency-Exchange-gold)](https://neotecs.netlify.app/docs/javascript#convertir-divisas)



The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
