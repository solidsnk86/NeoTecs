[![API_Routes](https://img.shields.io/badge/API-Routes-lime)](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)

I have created this REST API to be used in an example for JavaScript, allowing access to currency exchange functionality, can be accessed on [https://neotecs.netlify.app/api/currency](https://neotecs.netlify.app/api/currency). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/currency.js`.

If you are intrested how i use this REST API, i leave the example in this link below ðŸ‘‡

[![Currency Exchange](https://img.shields.io/badge/Currency-Exchange-gold)](https://neotecs.netlify.app/docs/javascript#convertir-divisas)

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
